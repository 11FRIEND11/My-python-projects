This folder consists of the a text file which the code will be texted on.
file_encryptor.txt contains python code that will be used to encryt and decrypt the message
this folder also contains a secret.key which is the key for decryption


To encrypt the file using the terminal, run this code:
python3 AES_Encryptor.py encrypt message.txt
--------------------------
This will create a new text file: message.txt.enc
it will also delete the original file making it unretainable without the security key 
-------------------------
-------------------------
to decrypt the file using the terminal, run this code:
python3 AES_Encryptor.py decrypt message.txt.enc
-------------------------
This will decrypt the file using the secret key and delete the encrypted file because it has no use


Important Notes:
Backup your secret key (secret.key). If lost, you won't be able to decrypt your files.
Ensure you enter commands correctly to avoid errors.
