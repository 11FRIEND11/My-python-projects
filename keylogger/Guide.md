This is a simple Keylogger made for educational purposes only (i swear). Please ensure you use it responsibly and only on 
systems where you have permission to do so, i am not responsible if any legal action is taken against you.

Instructions:

1. Install Dependencies:
   Make sure pynput is installed. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
   ~~~console
   pip install pynput
   ~~~

3. Running the Script:
   Once pynput is installed, you can run the keylogger by executing the script:
   ~~~console
   python3 keylogger.py
   ~~~
   The keylogger will start capturing the keys you press and will log them to keylog.txt.

5. Stopping the Keylogger:
   To stop the keylogger, press Ctrl + C in your terminal. This will stop the script from running.

Important Notes:
- This script is intended for learning and understanding how keyloggers work.
 It should not be used to record other people's keystrokes without their permission.
- Security Considerations: The keylogger logs all keystrokes, including sensitive information 
(e.g., passwords, private messages). Ensure you delete the log file (keylog.txt) after use and never share it.
- Always obtain consent before running keyloggers on any system that is not your own.
