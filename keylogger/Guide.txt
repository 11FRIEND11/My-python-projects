This is a simple Keylogger made for educational purposes only. Please ensure you use it responsibly and only on 
systems where you have explicit permission to do so.

Instructions:

1. Install Dependencies:
   Make sure pynput is installed. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:
   pip install pynput

2. Running the Script:
   Once pynput is installed, you can run the keylogger by executing the script:
   python3 keylogger.py
   The keylogger will start capturing the keys you press and will log them to keylog.txt.

3. Stopping the Keylogger:
   To stop the keylogger, press Ctrl + C in your terminal. This will stop the script from running.

Important Notes:
- For Educational Use Only: This script is intended for learning and understanding how keyloggers work.
 It should not be used to record other people's keystrokes without their permission.
- Security Considerations: The keylogger logs all keystrokes, including sensitive information 
(e.g., passwords, private messages). Ensure you delete the log file (keylog.txt) after use and never share it.
- Ethical Use: Always obtain consent before running keyloggers on any system that is not your own.
