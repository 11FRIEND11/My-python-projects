# My Python Projects

A collection of Python projects focused on cryptography, including AES and RSA encryption and decryption.

## Projects

### AES Encryption and Decryption
This folder contains Python code to perform AES encryption and decryption on files. The code implements AES with key management and file encryption/decryption.

### RSA Encryption and Decryption
This folder contains Python code to perform RSA encryption and decryption on files. The code implements RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption.

## Installation

To use this project, you need Python 3 and the `cryptography` library.

```bash
pip install cryptography
